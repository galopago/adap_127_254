# 2x5 pin 1.27 mm male to 2.54 mm male header adapter PCB

The J-Link EDU Mini sports a 2x5 1.27 mm male connector and includes a female to female 2x5 1.27 mm ribbon cable for target connection.

If for some reason your target doesn't have the same connector (debug pins scattered somewhere on th PCB) or want to some circuit on a breadboard, this PCB wil ease the task.
